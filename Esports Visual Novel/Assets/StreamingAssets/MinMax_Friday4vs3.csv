hajoon? more like haPOO
these casters have no idea what theyre talking about
chat is so bronze how can you not understand that play
 I am not a viewbot. I am a normal chatter in Velocity's chat. This is not suspicious at all. Great play Velocity! You're the best
i think the casters are doing a good job tbh. casting Pantheon is hard
i have 5 more ads to watch let me know what's happening
zzzzzz so tired of this meta just nerf Helios already
