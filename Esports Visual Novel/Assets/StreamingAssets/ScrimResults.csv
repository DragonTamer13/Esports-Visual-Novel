4,2,4,3,"Very talented player, but isn't playing with the team as needed."
5,3,4,2,"Another exceptional talent, as expected from someone of his caliber. Unfortunately doesn't seem to exactly get along with everyone."
2,5,4,2,"Really struggling on the Athena hero, and keeps cursing and taking up comm space when he dies."
4,4,2,3,Understands their role on the team well. Doesn't communicate enough though.
3,4,2,5,"Gameplay is pretty average, but he could be a great motivator on the team if he communicated more often."
4,2,4,3,"Once again, the skill is there but we need more coordinated plays with the team."
5,3,4,2,"He tries to be the hero constantly, and sometimes it works, but it could be guaranteed if he tried to work with the team and ask for more support."
2,5,4,2,"Still struggling to play Athena, and it might be taking a toll on his mental."
3,4,2,3,Struggled a little bit against an unconventional Loki pick. Still needs to communicate more.
3,4,4,5,Took the coaching yesterday to heart and really stepped up on the communication.
5,3,4,4,"Played well on Helios, but had a tendency to run ahead of team and overextend, leaving the backline vulnerable."
5,2,4,3,"Very solid Artemis gameplay, yet often split from team to be a one-man army. Wasn't punished by enemy team for it, but that's not a guarantee forever."
3,5,5,1,Kept trying to one-trick with Athena to mediocre results. Hades gameplay was average. Several instances of toxic all-chat behavior.
5,4,1,4,"Heavily needs to work on communicating during team fights, but otherwise good."
3,5,5,5,"Had some trouble playing Ra, but performed quite well using Persephone. Great team fight coordination."
