4,4,2,3,Understands their role on the team well. Doesn't communicate enough though.
3,4,2,5,"Gameplay is pretty average, but he could be a great motivator on the team if he communicated more often."
4,2,4,3,"Once again, the skill is there but we need more coordinated plays with the team."
5,3,4,2,"He tries to be the hero constantly, and sometimes it works, but it could be guaranteed if he tried to work with the team and ask for more support."

,,,,"After the argument, she refuses to talk to Hajoon, and she’s doing the bare minimum to coordinate with the rest of the team. "
,,,,He’s no longer even trying to coordinate with the team. Constantly running off to do solo plays that puts him and the rest of the team in jeopardy.
,,,,Doing his best despite Maeday and Hajoon’s bickering. He’s even cut down on the complaints mid match.
,,,,"With the others not talking as much, Atropos has had more room to speak, but it’s still hard for them in this toxic team environment."
,,,,"Even Boiga was affected by the argument. Not as bad as the others, but still not his normal cheery self."
,,,,"With Hajoon working with the team now, Maeday is back to her normal self."
,,,,His gameplay is like night and day in comparison to yesterday. He’s including the rest of the team in his plays now.
,,,,"Gameplay was the usual from him, decent plays overall with some mistakes that could be cleaned up. "
,,,,"With everyone talking again, they’ve settled back to their usual cadence."
,,,,"Doing good today. Like Velocity, just some mistakes that could be cleaned up."
