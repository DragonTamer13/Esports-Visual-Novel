5,3,4,4,"Played well on Helios, but had a tendency to run ahead of team and overextend, leaving the backline vulnerable."
5,2,4,3,"Very solid Artemis gameplay, yet often split from team to be a one-man army. Wasn't punished by enemy team for it, but that's not a guarantee forever."

5,4,1,4,"Heavily needs to work on communicating during team fights, but otherwise good."
3,5,5,5,"Had some trouble playing Ra, but performed quite well using Persephone. Great team fight coordination."
